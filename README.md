This is simple Tkinter based GUI that allows you to Read and Store Data coming from an Arduino or other UART compatible boards.

You will need to install pyserial library by-

You will also need to create data.txt in the same place where this code lies. All the data will be stored in this file.

Feel Free to Clone this and make changes as per your Requirements.
